# Custom-Tamil-Language-Word-Embedding
Developed a custom word embedding model tailored for the Tamil language using a chunk-based preprocessing and online training approach. The project efficiently handles large datasets, saving preprocessed data in manageable chunks and incrementally training the model, ensuring scalability and robustness in handling Tamil text.

This repository contains the complete pipeline for building a custom Tamil word embedding model using Gensim. The project focuses on creating a high-quality word2vec model tailored specifically for the Tamil language. The dataset used for this project has already been collected and saved in the wordembdataset folder. For details on web scraping and dataset collection methods, please refer to the separate repository dedicated to those topics.

## Key Features
- Custom Word Embedding: Develops a specialized Tamil language embedding using Gensimâ€™s word2vec implementation.
- Chunk Processing: Efficiently handles large datasets by processing in manageable chunks, ensuring memory efficiency.
- Online Training: Supports incremental training, allowing the model to be updated with new data without retraining from scratch.
- Comprehensive Workflow: From preprocessing text to building initial vocabulary, training the embedding model, and converting it to a binary format for efficient storage.
  # Getting Started
      ```base
       pip install gensim
   ## Project Structure
    - Preprocessing: The initial step where raw text data is cleaned and tokenized.
    - Initial Vocabulary: Creates the initial vocabulary from the preprocessed data.
    - Vocabulary: Updates and refines the vocabulary based on frequency and relevance.
    - Embedding Model: Trains the word2vec model using the processed dataset.
    - Compress to Bin: Converts the trained model into a binary format for easy use and deployment.

   ## Datasets
    The datasets required for training the model have been pre-collected and are available in the wordembdataset folder. These include a variety of Tamil texts sourced from different domains to ensure a well-rounded embedding.

   ## Training the Model
    The training process is designed to be efficient, leveraging chunk processing and online training. This approach allows the model to handle large volumes of data without overwhelming system resources and enables continuous updates to the model as new data becomes available.
